# Data Persistence

In this worksheet you will learn how to connect your code to a variety of different persistence frameworks. We will cover:

1. Relational databases (MySQL)
2. Document databases (MongoDB)
3. Graph databases (Neo4J)

In each of these cases you will be shown how to use NodeJS to carry out the basic **CRUD** operations, it is assumed that you already understand how to work with the databases.

## 1 MySQL

This is the most popular _relational_ database. It's cross-platform and open source.

Rather than install MySQL on your machine we will be hosting it on the [db4free](https://mysql8.db4free.net) servers. You first step is to sign up for a free account. As part of this process you will be sent a confirmation email. This can take a while to arrive.

## 2 MongoDB

This is the most popular _document_ database. It's cross-platform and open source.

Rather than install MongoDB on your machine we will be hosting it on the [mlab](https://mlab.com) servers. You first step is to sign up for a free account. As part of this process you will be sent a confirmation email.

## 3 Neo4J

This is the most popular _graph_ database. It's cross-platform and open source.

Rather than install Neo4J on your machine we will be hosting it on the [GrapheneDB](http://www.graphenedb.com) servers. You first step is to sign up for a free account.
